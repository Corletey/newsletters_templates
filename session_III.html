          <!-- <p class="byline">By Dr. Amina Diallo, AAU Chief Correspondent</p> -->
          <p class="article-text">
            At the Association of African Universities’ 16th General Conference
            in Rabat, Morocco, the African Union Commission, represented by
            Chigozie Emmanuel Okonkwo, unveiled two landmark frameworks—the
            Continental Education Strategy for Africa (CESA) 2026–2035 and the
            African Continental TVET Strategy 2025–2034. The session highlighted
            how these strategies aim to redefine Africa’s educational and skills
            landscape, tackling systemic challenges and fostering human capital
            development essential for the continent’s sustainable growth.

            Plenary Session III of AAU’s 16th Quadrennial General Conference in
            Rabat, Morocco, spotlighted education as the cornerstone of Africa’s
            sustainable future. With the African Union Commission’s Chigozie
            Emmanuel Okonkwo delivering a compelling presentation, participants
            were introduced to the ambitious Continental Education Strategy for
            Africa (CESA) 2026–2035 and the African Continental Technical and
            Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Strategy 2025–2034.
            Together, these robust frameworks chart a transformative path to
            empower Africa’s human capital for prosperity, equity, and
            innovation.

          <h3>
            CESA 2026–2035: A Vision for Inclusive, Future-Ready Education
          </h3>
          <!-- <div class="author">By L. Abidou & R. Traore</div> -->
          <p>
            Building on the gains and lessons of its predecessor (CESA
            2016–2025), the new strategy emphasizes that education is not a
            privilege for select few Africans but a fundamental human right for
            all. It identifies key pillars such as skills acquisition,
            socio-economic development, and labour market alignment as critical
            levers for individual and collective prosperity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This updated CESA framework prioritizes teachers’ central role,
            effective school leadership, lifelong learning, digitalization,
            artificial intelligence integration, and education system resilience
            to address contemporary challenges and explore opportunities.
            “Investing in education is not merely a moral imperative; it is a
            smart economic and social strategy,” Okonkwo stressed, linking
            education to lower mortality rates, improved health outcomes,
            women’s empowerment, and increased earning potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new CESA’s overarching goal is to build an integrated,
            prosperous, and peaceful Africa driven by African citizens. The
            strategy directly responds to the persistent burning issues in
            African HE, such as gender disparities, low funding, low enrolment,
            low levels of foundational skills, and low completion rates across
            educational levels. To enable it to achieve its 20 objectives, the
            strategy has been structured around six strategic areas.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Resources and Enabling Environment, which emphasizes
              evidence-based policies, robust governance, sustainable funding,
              strong partnerships, up-to-date curricular, digitalization and
              greening, and expanded infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Teachers, Educators, and Caregivers, aiming to improve teacher
              policies, enhance education and professional development, upgrade
              the attractiveness of the teaching profession, and increase
              investment in school leadership, particularly for female leaders.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Basic Education, which seeks to ensure cost effective approaches
              to early childhood development and foundational learning,
              investment in emotional skills, and promotion of 21st-century
              labour market skills, including ICT, AI, and STEAM.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Higher Education and TVET, focusing on strengthening links between
              TVET and the labour market, expanding access and quality of HE,
              and incentivizing research.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Second Chance Programmes and Lifelong Learning aims to expand
              opportunities for out-of-school children, adult-literacy
              campaigns, and support for lifelong learning.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Gender Equity and Inclusion seeks to promote gender equality in
              and through education, reduce the cost of schooling for equity,
              and ensure inclusiveness of vulnerable groups.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These six strategic areas—from basic to higher education to lifelong
            learning—are designed to be interconnected and mutually reinforcing
            to provide a holistic educational framework and create a resilient
            and inclusive African education ecosystem, ensuring that all its
            critical areas are addressed in a coordinated fashion.

            African Continental TVET Strategy: Skills for Prosperity and
            Inclusion
          </h3>
          <!-- <div class="author">By S. Diallo</div> -->
          <p>
            In a paradigm shift, the new TVET Strategy expands beyond youth
            employability to include all Africans—women, migrants, rural
            populations, informal workers, displaced people, and people with
            disabilities—and empower them to level up. Titled “Sustainable
            Development, Social Justice and Employability for All,” the strategy
            aligns with AU’s Agenda 2063 and UN’s Sustainable Development Goals,
            seeking to cultivate a globally competitive and innovative African
            workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing the transformative impact of emerging dynamics, such as
            technology advancements, climate shifts, and demographic changes,
            the strategy proactively addresses critical TVET sector challenges,
            including underfunding, gender gaps, skills mismatches, low
            enrolment, weak institutional systems, poor perception of TVET
            programmes, and lack of a robust quality assurance mechanism. It
            also considers the importance of people’s mental health and
            well-being in the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its four transformation pillars—policy governance and finance,
            quality and inclusion, partnerships, and resource sharing—work in
            tandem with three guiding principles to reposition TVET as a
            powerful engine for Africa’s development. These guiding principles
            work synergistically to create a comprehensive framework, harnessing
            the full potential of technical and vocational education and
            training across the continent as a powerful engine for development.

            The session’s panellists, including AAU’s Secretary General, Prof. Olusola Oyewole, called on African higher education institutions (HEIs) and stakeholders to adopt and adapt these policies within their unique contexts. They urged participants to access the frameworks via SDG forums and AAU’s website, ratify the Addis Convention, strengthen institutional data reporting, and forge partnerships for coordinated action.

            Closing the session, Prof. Oyewole commended the African Union Commission for its leadership in shaping a comprehensive educational roadmap for the continent. He also expressed his profound pride in partnering the AU Commission on CESA’s development and implementation to drive comprehensive education in Africa. Celebrating their active participation and significant contributions to the session in particular and Africa’s higher education landscape in general, Prof. Oyewole adorned the panellists with AAU-branded regalia.

            The unveiling of CESA 2026–2035 and the African Continental TVET Strategy 2025–2034 marks a defining moment in Africa’s education journey. As Prof. Oyewole noted, their success depends on collective ownership and implementation by African institutions and governments. With bold strategies and unified action, Africa can transform its education systems into engines of innovation, inclusion, and sustainable development—bringing to life the vision of “The Africa We Want.”
