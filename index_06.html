                            innovation as a key driver of societal progress. The World Bank (2021) and the Organization
                            for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2015) also emphasize the importance of
                            research innovation, especially in developing economies. While the OECD recognizes the
                            importance of science, technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the World Bank,
                            through both words and actions, highlights the roles of universities, research centers, and
                            industry partnerships not only in generating knowledge but also in transforming it into
                            real-world solutions that have a meaningful impact on sustainable growth.</p>

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>Many have likely wondered how many women in sub-Saharan Africa lose their lives due to
                            pregnancy or its management, only to be confronted with a heartbreaking reality they wish
                            they didn’t know. According to the latest (2010-2020) data on maternal mortality rates,
                            jointly published by the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, UNPF, and UNPD, sub-Saharan Africa alone
                            contributes a staggering 70% of the world's maternal mortality rate. Beyond statistically
                            pushing the world average from 53 to 223, the region’s alarming 545 maternal deaths per
                            100,000 live births pose a severe threat to the Sustainable Development Goal Target 3.1,
                            which aims to reduce maternal mortality to fewer than 70 by 2030. With only five years
                            remaining, the World Bank ACE Impact project provides a glimmer of hope.</p>

                        <p>The Bank’s Centre of Excellence in Reproductive Health Innovation (CERHI) is diligently
                            working to ensure that the 2030 target remains achievable, leveraging the synergy of
                            innovation, commitment, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. As part of this pursuit, the
                            center recently identified widespread inaccessible emergency healthcare as a major cause of
                            the region’s high maternal mortality rates and proposed actionable solutions to address the
                            issue. Diagnosing the problem, the center first summarized the region’s high maternal
                            mortality rates in a 3-delay model—the delay in deciding to seek care, the delay in reaching
                            care, and the delay in receiving care, with the first phase being the most critical not only
                            because the two other phases depend on it but also because it combines their
                            causes—inaccessible health facilities and poor-quality healthcare—with other causes such as
                            socio-economic and cultural factors. This means that by addressing Phase 1 delays, maternal
                            mortality rates could be significantly reduced. </p>

                        <p>Leading this timely intervention, the center has developed the Text4Life Mobile App, an
                            innovative telemedicine platform, to bridge the gap between rural communities and emergency
                            care providers, addressing maternal health emergencies.</p>

                                healthcare facilities. The emergency call system has so far significantly decreased
                                delays in accessing critical maternal health services. In one of the highest maternal
                                mortality communities in Nigeria, where the mobile innovation was implemented, no one

                    </h3>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>In rural communities across Northern Ghana, access to clean and safe drinking water has been
                            a persistent challenge. Water bodies, once reliable sources, have become contaminated with
                            hazardous levels of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury, largely due to the rise of
                            unregulated mining activities. Unfortunately, filtering and removing these contaminants is
                            an expensive and complex process. </p>

                        <p>
                            This contamination poses severe health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations who
                            rely on these water sources for their daily needs. In response to this pressing challenge,
                            the West African Centre for Water, Irrigation and Sustainable Agriculture (WACWISA) at the
                            University for Development Studies (UDS), developed a groundbreaking, low-cost ceramic water
                            filter. This innovation is not only transforming health outcomes but also empowering
                            communities by utilizing locally available materials.
                        </p>

                            <div class="image-caption">Locally-produced ceramic water filters are transforming
                                health outcomes</div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="highlight">
                            <p>The WACWISA ceramic filter employs agricultural by-products such as rice husks,
                                sheanut shells, and groundnut shells, combined with zeolite for enhanced
                                filtration.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>These materials are charred, milled, and mixed with clay, then fired in a kiln at 850°C to
                            create durable ceramic filters. This process effectively removes up to 98.7% of arsenic and
                            mercury from water, offering a life-changing solution for those affected by water pollution.
                            <b>Over 200 individuals in five rural communities</b> have benefited from these filters,
                            significantly improving access to clean water and reducing the prevalence of waterborne
                            diseases.</p>
                        <p>The success of the project is not only in the technology itself but also in the community
                            engagement and knowledge transfer facilitated by WACWISA. <b>Local residents have been
                                trained to produce these filters</b>, creating a sustainable model that empowers
                            communities to manage their water quality independently. This initiative not only addresses
                            health concerns but also promotes economic growth by fostering local entrepreneurship and
                            reducing reliance on costly imported solutions.</p>

                        <h3>Impact and Future Potential</h3>
                        <p>The ceramic filters provide an affordable, scalable, and environmentally friendly method for
                            purifying water. By using locally sourced materials, production costs are minimized, making
                            the filters accessible to even the most resource-constrained households. The filters'
                            ability to remove harmful heavy metals dramatically reduces the risks of chronic diseases
                            such as cancer and neurological disorders, which are linked to arsenic and mercury exposure.
                        </p>
                        <p>A benefit-cost analysis of the project revealed a favorable <b>ratio of 1.06</b>, indicating
                            the viability of scaling this solution as a profitable and sustainable business venture. As
                            the technology gains traction, <b>it has the potential to benefit thousands more across
                                Ghana and beyond</b>. The simplicity of the production process, combined with the
                            effectiveness of the filters, makes it an ideal solution for widespread adoption in regions
                            grappling similar water contamination challenges.Looking forward, WACWISA aims to expand the
                            reach of this innovation by partnering with governmental and non-governmental organizations
                            to facilitate mass production and distribution. By continuing to train local communities and
                            build capacity, this project is poised to ensure that every household in Northern Ghana—and
                            potentially across Africa—has access to clean, safe drinking water.</p>

                                Northern Ghana</div>

                            <p>Beyond this key innovation, the center has significantly improved the livelihoods of
                                people, especially local farmers in Ghana through other tailored innovations. These
                                include improved shea roaster to boost productivity for women in Northern Ghana. Shea
                                butter processing is a vital source of income for rural women in Northern Ghana, yet
                                traditional methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and contribute to environmental
                                degradation. To address these issues, <b>WACWISA, in collaboration with UNIDO, developed
                                    an improved Shea roaster</b> using locally available materials. This innovative
                                roaster, distributed to <b>14 women’s groups</b> across the Upper East, Upper West, and
                                Northern regions, has transformed the Shea butter production process. The new technology
                                led to a <b>40% increase in butter yield and a 30% improvement in fatty acid quality</b>
                                (Stearic, Oleic, Palmitic, and Linoleic). Additionally, the roaster ensures heat
                                distribution, reduces fuelwood consumption, and minimizes environmental impact.</p>


                            <p>The initiative has trained <b>504 Shea butter processors</b> and <b>28 local
                                    fabricators</b>, equipping communities with the skills and tools to sustain their
                                livelihoods. This breakthrough not only improves productivity and quality but also
                                supports the fight against climate change, offering rural women a path to economic
                                empowerment and environmental sustainability.</p>

                            <p>Amid global water scarcity, traditional irrigation methods often result in water waste
                                and reduced crop yields. To tackle this challenge, <b>WACWISA researchers adopted a
                                    data-driven approach</b> to design a smart irrigation system specifically for tomato
                                farming. By modeling soil moisture dynamics and using <b>MATLAB-based predictive control
                                    algorithms</b>, this system adapts irrigation to real-time conditions, optimizing
                                water use. Field trials demonstrated that this smart irrigation approach achieved a
                                <b>29% reduction in water usage</b> and significantly improved water use
                                efficiency—yielding up to <b>10.4 kg of tomatoes per cubic meter of water </b> (compared
                                to 7.1 kg/m³ for open-loop and 5.6 kg/m³ for manual methods). The system accurately
                                predicts irrigation needs, reducing both over- and under-watering, and lowering
                                operational costs for farmers.</p>

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>In Togo, poultry farming plays a pivotal role in the agricultural economy, accounting for 14%
                            of the sector's GDP. Despite this importance, the industry has long struggled with high
                            costs and a heavy dependency on imported feed concentrates, which represent 70% of
                            production costs. These challenges have limited productivity and forced the country to rely
                            on significant poultry imports to meet national demands.</p>

                        <h3>The Problem: Expensive and Imported Feed</h3>
                        <p>The high cost of imported feed concentrates has hindered the growth of modern poultry farming
                            in Togo, leading to inefficiencies and disinvestment by farmers. In 2020, the country
                            imported 24,717 tonnes of poultry meat and offal to address the production gap. Without
                            affordable, high-quality feed, the poultry industry continues to struggle to meet the
                            national demand and remains uncompetitive.</p>
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <p>To address this challenge, the <b>Regional Center of Excellence in Poultry Sciences
                                    (CERSA)</b> developed an innovative feed concentrate made from <b>black soldier fly
                                    maggots</b>. This locally produced concentrate offers high nutritional and
                                microbiological quality, rivaling imported alternatives. It provides essential proteins,
                                vitamins, and minerals needed to balance poultry feed rations, reducing reliance on
                                costly imports and supporting sustainable farming practices.</p>

                        </h3>

                        <p>Under the leadership of <b>Dr. Attivi</b>, the project focuses on harnessing the
                            nutrient-rich potential of black soldier fly larvae. The concentrate is produced through a
                            rigorous process that ensures superior quality and cost-effectiveness. This innovation not
                            only reduces production costs but also promotes environmental sustainability by utilizing
                            organic waste to cultivate the maggots.</p>

                            <p>The Center has addressed the need for modern educational facilities by constructing a
                                state-of-the-art administrative and academic complex. Laboratories at the ENS (École
                                Normale Supérieure) were rehabilitated and student living spaces upgraded to foster a
                                conducive learning environment.
                                By accrediting training programs, the Center promotes excellence and reinforces high
                                standards in education.
