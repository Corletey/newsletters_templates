            The Association of African Universities (AAU), in collaboration with
            UNESCO, launched its Executive Leadership Training Programme on
            Sunday, July 20, 2025, at the UNESCO Regional Office for the Maghreb
            in Rabat, Morocco. The venue symbolizes UNESCO’s commitment to
            regional collaboration and leadership development in African higher
            education.
          </p>
          <p>
            This full-day session marked the beginning of a transformative
            initiative aimed at equipping senior leaders in African higher
            education institutions with the tools, knowledge, and networks
            necessary to lead digital transformation and institutional change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Executive Training held as one of the three preconference events
            to the 16th AAU General Conference , brought together
            Vice-Chancellors, Rectors, Deans, and senior policymakers from
            across the continent. The training which aimed to address leadership
            gaps, promote gender-inclusive governance, and prepare African HEIs
            for the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation went
            beyond traditional workshops by positioning digital transformation
            as a long-term, institution-wide journey to meet up growing demands
            for digital integration and evolving expectations of students and
            societies.
          </p>
          <p>
            This initiative aligns with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5
            (Gender Equality) and contributes to UNESCO’s Campus Africa
            Flagship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The training was facilitated by a distinguished team of experts ,
            including Dr. Borhene Chakroun, Director of the Division for
            Policies and Lifelong Learning Systems at UNESCO, and Charaf
            Ahmimed, Programme Specialist at the UNESCO Rabat Office. Other
            notable contributors included Ilham Laaziz, Director of the GENIE
            Programme at Morocco’s Ministry of Education; Salma Karim, Head of
            Human Capital and Innovation at the Agence de développement du
            Digital (ADD); and Rajid Serraj, Director of the Africa Initiative &
            Strategy for Agriculture ,Water and Climate at Mohammed VI
            Polytechnic University. International perspectives were shared by
            Monique Brodeur, President of the Higher Education Council of
            Quebec, and Sehl Mellouli, Deputy Vice-Rector at Université Laval in
            Canada. The AAU and UNESCO leadership teams, including Prof. Juliet
            Thondhlana, Carmela Salzano, and Hélène Guiol, also played key roles
            in guiding the discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The training began with welcome and opening remarks by Dr. Borhene
            Chakroun, and Charaf Ahmimed all from UNESCO. Their remarks set the
            tone for a day of deep reflection, strategic dialogue, and
            collaborative learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The training featured series of panel discussions and workshops with
            the first panel focused on institutional adaptation to digital
            transformation and artificial intelligence, featuring African case
            studies. Speakers shared real-world examples of how higher education
            institutions on the continent are navigating the challenges and
            opportunities of digital transformation. They highlighted innovative
            strategies, leadership approaches, and lessons learned from their
            respective contexts.

          <!-- <div class="author">By S. Diallo</div> -->
          <p>
            The second panel explored the role of higher education councils in
            enabling and guiding digital transformation. Discussions emphasized
            the importance of regulatory and policy frameworks, collaboration
            among institutions, and the need for councils to support inclusive
            and quality-driven digital education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the panels, participants engaged in two interactive
            workshops. The first workshop guided leaders through the process of
            mapping their institutions’ digital and data ecosystems. This
            hands-on session helped participants assess their digital maturity,
            identify gaps, and begin drafting roadmaps for transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second workshop introduced Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model as a
            practical framework for leading institutional change. Participants
            examined how to build urgency, form guiding coalitions, and sustain
            momentum for digital innovation within their institutions. The
            workshop encouraged leaders to think strategically about change
            management in the context of AI and digital integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants were introduced to UNESCO’s six key pillars of the
            Digital Transformation Collaborative. These pillars outline the
            essential components for effective and coordinated digital
            transformation in higher education. They include leadership and
            strategic coordination, robust connectivity and infrastructure,
            institutional capacities and culture that support technology
            adoption, and the use of data to inform decision-making. This
            framework provided a structured lens through which participants
            could assess their institutions’ readiness and plan for sustainable
            digital change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The day concluded with a closing plenary session titled “From
            Reflection to Action – Your First Leadership Move.” This session
            encouraged participants to consolidate their learning and articulate
            concrete first step they would take to initiate or accelerate
            digital transformation at their institutions. Each leader left with
            a personalized action plan and a renewed sense of purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            This training session was not only a standalone event but also the
            first module in a broader leadership development pathway under
            UNESCO’s Campus Africa Flagship. The programme is designed to offer
            ongoing mentorship, coaching, and peer learning opportunities over
            the next 6 to 12 months. Participants will be supported in
            implementing their institutional roadmaps and will have access to a
            network of Digital Transformation Coaches and practical resources.

            The Executive Leadership Training Programme is a timely and
            strategic response to the challenges facing African higher
            education. It aims to build a critical mass of digitally literate,
            gender-responsive, and future-ready leaders who can drive
            sustainable transformation across the continent. As the AAU General
            Conference continues, the momentum generated on Day One sets the
            stage for deeper engagement and long-term impact.

            A second session of the Executive Leadership Programme will take
            place on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, as a side event during the main
            conference. This follow-up session will further consolidate the
            lessons learned and provide additional tools for institutional
            change and innovation.
