            As African universities navigate growing expectations to drive
            innovation, address development challenges, and prepare future-ready
            graduates, institutional transformation is no longer optional. It is
            both essential and strategic. At the 16th Quadrennial General
            Conference of the Association of African Universities (AAU), holding
            in Rabat, Morocco, from July 21 to 25, 2025, two presentations from
            Professor Lex Paulsen and Dr. Rachid Serraj of University Mohammed
            VI Polytechnic (UM6P) offered compelling insights into how
            universities can lead this transformation. The first, delivered by
            Professor Paulsen, introduced UM6P’s internal planning model, Vision
            2030, which seeks to redefine institutional strategy through
            inclusive, bottom-up engagement. The second presentation, made by
            Dr. Serraj, proposed a continent-wide framework grounded in
            collective intelligence to foster collaboration, innovation, and
            long-term impact.

          <p>
            Building resilient higher education institutions in Africa requires
            more than conventional top-down planning. It demands an approach
            rooted in innovation, inclusiveness, and adaptability. In a rapidly
            changing global environment, universities face mounting pressures to
            respond to complex challenges such as shifting demographics, digital
            transformation, disruptions of artificial intelligence, and
            accelerating impacts of climate change. Addressing these demands
            calls for institutions that are agile, inclusive, and innovation
            driven. It also requires new models of governance, collaboration,
            and knowledge production that are aligned with national priorities
            and Africa’s broader development agenda.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is within this evolving context that UM6P, in 2023,
            conceptualized, developed, and launched its vision for 2030. The
            initiative was conceived as a transformative roadmap to align the
            university’s strategic priorities with the changing needs of Morocco
            and the continent. Unlike conventional institutional planning,
            UM6P’s Vision 2030 embraces a bottom-up approach, leveraging the
            collective intelligence of UM6P’s ecosystem—students, faculty,
            researchers, staff, and external partners—to co-create a shared
            vision for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emerging as a model of participatory governance, Vision 2030 was
            spotlighted during AAU’s General Conference under the theme “Shaping
            the Future of Higher Education for Innovation and Sustainable
            Development in Africa.” Professor Lex Paulsen of UM6P’s School of
            Collective Intelligence delivered an in-depth presentation,
            demonstrating how African universities can actively engage their
            communities in shaping responsive, actionable strategies.

          <p>
            Vision 2030 is not a static strategic plan. It is a continuous
            learning process, a cycle of reflection, adaptation, and
            collaborative design. Initiated by the President’s Office, the
            vision is refined through annual review cycles, engagement with new
            opportunities, and creation of cross-departmental “experiment teams”
            tasked with addressing the university’s most pressing challenges.
            This approach ensures that Vision 2030 remains responsive,
            future-focused, and community-driven. Its objective is not merely to
            define a vision, but to shape a dynamic institutional identity that
            evolves over time. The initiative draws deeply on the science of
            collective intelligence. It combines divergent thinking to generate
            ideas through town halls, interviews, and workshops, with convergent
            thinking, which synthesizes insights, prioritizes actions, and
            builds consensus. This methodology promotes inclusiveness, strategic
            clarity, and legitimacy, enabling the university to stay aligned
            with both its internal aspirations and the broader external context.
            This initiative has contributed to UM6P’s rising global visibility,
            including its recognition among the top 500 universities worldwide
            by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, a testament
            to the power of inclusive and forward-looking institutional
            planning, according to Khalid Baddou, Chief of Staff, UM6P and the
            Chair for the plenary session.

            The Collective Intelligence of African Universities
          </h3>
          <p>
            Referencing UM6P’s Vision 2030 in his address, Dr. Rachid Serraj
            urged the participants to leverage the experiences of institutional
            transformation and transition the conversation to a continental
            scale. While African universities continue to demonstrate impressive
            innovations, the broader system remains constrained by
            fragmentation, inadequate infrastructure, and a persistent
            disconnect between research and real-world application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many institutions, he explained, lack the laboratory space and
            incubation facilities needed to advance prototypes. Fewer than 5% of
            university patents make it to the market. This disconnect not only
            stalls technological progress but also leaves industries across the
            continent struggling to find the talent and solutions they require.
            This challenge calls for a new model of academic cooperation, one
            grounded in the collective intelligence of African universities.
            Rather than working in isolation, institutions must align strategies
            that reflect Africa’s development priorities. The aim is not simply
            to share resources but to build integrated systems that advance
            knowledge production, support innovation, and prepare a workforce
            equipped to shape the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support this ambition, UM6P proposed the establishment of an
            African HESTI Transformation Alliance (AHTA). The initiative
            envisions a pan-African framework to enhance collaboration across
            institutions, sectors, and borders, built around four strategic
            pillars of Digitally Integrated Universities, A Continental
            Innovation Engine, The Future Talent Force, and Policy Alignment and
            Harmonization.
          </p>
          <p>
            For collaboration to succeed, enabling policies must be in place.
            Harmonized standards in accreditation, mobility, research
            governance, and intellectual property will strengthen institutional
            partnerships and scale sustainable impact.
          </p>

            According to Dr. Serraj, this alliance builds on the work already
            underway in institutions like UM6P. Vision 2030 stands as one
            institutional example. The next step is a pan-African
            transformation, driven by collective purpose and coordinated action.

            The two presentations delivered on Day 1 of the General Conference
            reflect a growing shift in how African universities view their role.
            Universities are no longer only centers of teaching and research but
            are increasingly recognized as strategic actors in driving
            system-wide transformation. UM6P’s Vision 2030 illustrates how a
            university can turn inward to redefine its purpose and outward to
            align with national and continental goals. The proposed African
            HESTI Transformation Alliance builds on this experience, offering a
            collaborative framework for innovation, integration, and talent
            development across the continent.

          <p>
            As Africa works toward the aspirations of Agenda 2063, unlocking the
            collective intelligence of its universities is not only a strategic
            imperative. It is central to realizing the continent’s development
            vision. The Association of African Universities (AAU), as the
            convening and coordinating platform for higher education in the
            region, plays a critical role in advancing this agenda. By fostering
            dialogue, strengthening partnerships, and championing innovation in
            education, AAU enables institutions to move from isolated excellence
            to coordinated impact.

          <p>
            This moment calls for a shared commitment to act. Reimagining
            African higher education as a driver of inclusive growth and
            sustainable development requires collective effort. Universities,
            governments, industries, and communities must come together to shape
            a future rooted in Africa’s own knowledge systems. The foundation is
            in place. The time to accelerate progress is now.
